Hi! My name is Carolyn Drake and I am currently a five year graduate student in the Astronomy and Physics department at Vanderbilt University working under Dr. Jessie Runnoe. Originally from outside Houston, I went to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington for my undergraduate degree. I set up this little website as a quick and easy way to get to know me and what I do. There is also contact info at the bottom of the page if you would like to reach me about a specific question or are interested in any of the work I do and would like to chat! Thanks for stopping by!

## Research

Working towards coordinating electromagnetic (EM) follow-up for future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detections by comparing simulated LISA parameter estimations with galaxies that may host LISA-like massive black holes binaries which have been observed in large area sky surveys.

## Papers

<b>Carolyn L. Drake</b>, J. Runnoe, et. al., "Preliminary Census of LISA-type Error Volumes using SDSS Photo-
metery", in prep, expected 2024

Daniel A. Dale and Kristin R. Anderson and Louis M. Bran and Isaiah S. Cox and <b>Carolyn L. Drake</b> and

Galaxies", AJ, 159, 5

## Hobbies

Outside of work, my main hobbies include baking, movies (some of my favorites being: [When Harry Met Sally](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/), [Rear Window](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047396/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), [Clue](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), and [After Yang](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8633464/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)), photography, and knitting and crocheting. Some photos I've taken and pies I've baked can be seen below! :)
