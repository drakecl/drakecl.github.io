# About

Hi! My name is Carolyn Drake and I am currently a fifth year graduate student in the Physics and Astronomy department at Vanderbilt University working under Dr. Jessie Runnoe. Originally from outside Houston, I attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington for my undergraduate degree. There is contact info at the bottom of the page if you would like to reach me about a specific question or are interested in any of the work I do and would like to chat!

## Hobbies

Outside of work, my main hobbies include baking, movies (some of my favorites being: [When Harry Met Sally](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/), [Rear Window](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047396/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), [Clue](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)), photography, and knitting and crocheting. Some photos I've taken and pies I've baked can be seen below! :)
