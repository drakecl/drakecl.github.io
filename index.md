# About

Hi! My name is Carolyn Drake and I am currently a fifth year graduate student in the Physics and Astronomy department at Vanderbilt University working under Dr. Jessie Runnoe. Originally from outside Houston, I attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington for my undergraduate degree. There is contact info at the bottom of the page if you would like to reach me about a specific question or are interested in any of the work I do and would like to chat!
